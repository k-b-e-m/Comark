# Memory and storage
## Definition of memory
from an architects point of view a memory is seen as a solid-state digital device that provides storage for data values.
## The key aspect of memory
There is two choices when designing a memory system.

### Technology
*Technology* refers to the properties of the underlying hardware mechanism used to construct the memory system.
*Memory technology* refers to the lowest level hardware pieces.
### Organization
*Organization* refers to the way the underlying technology is used to form a working system. 
*Memory organization* refers to how the pieces are combined to form a storage system.


## Four characteristics of Memory Technologies

### Memory Volatility
A memory is *volatile* if the content of the memory disappear when power is removed. *Non volatile* is the oppisite. RAM is volatile and SSD is Non volatile.
### Memory Access paradigm
*Random access* all values in the memory is acessed in a fixed amount of time. This is what RAM (random access memory) is using.
*Sequential access* Here access to the data depends on the location in memory of the data. This could for example be memories following the FIFO principle
### Permanence of values
*ROM* read only memory.
*PROM* programmable read only memory
### Primary and secondary memory
*Primary memory*   fast, volatile, internal main memory.
*Secondary memory* SSD is used for secondary storage.
