# Operand Adressing And Instruction Representation
# CPUs: Microcode, Protection And Processor Modes
## CPU
CPU stands for Central Processing Unit.
Today Processors contain upwards of 2.5 billion transistors.
Modern Processors have multiple cores. Cores is smaller processors that function in parralel.

## Zero Operands per instruction
Known as a *0-address architecture*.
I possible when using a stack architecture. Example of this is seen below:
![[Figure 7.1.png]]
## One Operand Per Instruction
known as a *1-address* design, uses an accumumaltor. Example seen below:
![[example of 1-operand instruction.png]]
## Two Operands per instruction
Know as *2-address* architecture. 
![[Example of two operands per instruction.png]]
## Three operands per instruction
![[Example of 3 operands.png]]
Enables one to specify where to store result.
